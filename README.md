# Monroe Experiments
The master branch is the development branch.
5Genesis experiments for the Monroe VN component. Each folder contains a specific experiment/probe.

## Containers
The compiled versions of the experiments (ie containers) will be published on docker hub under the monroe organization with the same name as the folder, eg the ping experiment will be published as monroe/ping:5genesis-ReleaseA. ReleaseA referes to what 5Genesis release the experiment was developed for (ie Release A) and it corresponding branch. The master branch will use the tag 5genesis-master
